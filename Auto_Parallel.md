> 1. Propose **ColocNAS**, an end-to-end NAS framework which can automatically design parallel neural networks on multi device systems while maintaining high task accuracy.
> 2. Three phases of ColocNAS: Offline latency profiling, Online latency-aware searching, RL-based device placement fine-tuning.
